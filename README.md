# Front End Authority Website

This is the website codebase for the Front End Authority meetup group

This is a group project we are doing just for fun. We encourage everyone to take part, take risks, challenge yourself, and learn something cool!

Pull requests welcome! :muscle:

# SETUP

This [VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) project was setup with the Vue-Cli tool (`vue init webpack my-project`)

To get started:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

That's it :)

If you want to get fancy, you can build the project to be a production ready website (this will create all of the compiled files in the `dist` directory), or run tests

``` bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
